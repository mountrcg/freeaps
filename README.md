# FreeAPS X

## Introduction 

FreeAPS X - an artificial pancreas system for iOS developed by Ivan Valkou based on [OpenAPS Reference](https://github.com/openaps/oref0) algorithms.

FreeAPS X uses original JavaScript files of oref0 and provides a user interface (UI) to control and set up the system. 


To use this branch : 

git clone --branch=bdb https://github.com/Jon-b-m/freeaps.git

The bdb branch includes my implementation of dynamic ISF, dynamic CR and some other extra features. Dyn ISF and dyn CR are off by default. 

Please understand that this version is :
- highly experimental
- not approved for therapy
